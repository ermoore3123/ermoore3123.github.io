# About Me

# My Interests
I'm a passionate student with a deep interest in computers and web development, especially front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Outside of coding, I love playing games, hiking, and exploring new languages and cultures. I’m always eager to learn new things and challenge myself with creative projects.

# Websites I Recommend

- [GitHub](https://www.github.com) - GitHub is a platform for version control in software development. I find it useful for hosting my projects, collaborating with other developers and contributing to open-source projects.
- [Stack Overflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com) - Stack Overflow is a great resource for getting help with coding problems and learning from other developers. 
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org) - MDN is my go-to resource for all things web development. Whether I’m learning a new thing or troubleshooting a bug, MDN has super accurate and well-documented information on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more.

# Additional Information
I'm currently working on improving my skills in machine learning and want to become good and all stuff computer. I also enjoy playing games and reading books.
